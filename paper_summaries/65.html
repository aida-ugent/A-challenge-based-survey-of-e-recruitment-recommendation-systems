<p>This paper extends their previous work \cite{74/dave2018combined} to recommend jobs and job seekers. More specifically, they map job title and skills in the same latent space and then for a job posting/resume, they combine the job title (extracted from work experience), skills and location representations to get a single representation and utilize FAISS [1] for the recommendation.</p>
