<p>This paper proposes TAPJFNN, the topic-aware extension of their previous method APJFNN \cite{485/qin2018enhancing}. TAPJFNN contains the same components as APJFNN, except in computing the full job posting and resume embedding, where the attention mechanism also uses the topic distribution of job postings and resumes extracted by a pre-trained Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. Specifically, In computing the full job posting embedding, the attention mechanism also uses the topic distribution of the job posting. In computing the full resume embedding, the attention mechanism also uses the topic distribution of the job posting and the resume.</p>
<p>To predict the person-job fit, the representation of the job posting and the resume are passed to a fully-connected network. In order to leverage the resumes of job seekers who have previously applied for a specific job, a refinement strategy is designed. Specifically, a list of successful and failed applications for a specific job are selected. Next, a max-pooling and an attentional-pooling layers are applied on their embeddings. Finally, the two embeddings are passed along with the representation of the job posting and the resume to a fully connected network to predict the final person-job fit score.</p>
<p>A negative sampling strategy is also designed for the task of job recommendation, since failed applications does not necessarily mean that the job should not have been recommended to the job seeker. The probability of a job being recommended to a job seeker is estimated based on the similarity of the job and the job seeker successful job applications.</p>
