<p>This paper proposes a reciprocal recommendation system, where jobs and resumes have different feature fields such as education degree, work years, etc. It is assumed that features in resumes and jobs in the same field have the same type (numerical, categorical, etc.). They design a neural network model to learn the matching correlation between resumes and jobs based on feature field inner and outer interactions. First, they embed features of each field of resumes and jobs using a shared embedding matrix. The textual features are embedded with a pre-trained Bert model [1]. Next, the element-wise difference and element-wise product of the two the embedding of features of resumes and jobs in each field, and a mean-pooling layer to  aggregate the final representations, since resumes might have multiple features related to one field (e.g. desired cities). After that, a multi-head self-attention mechanism is applied to the resulting embedding of inner interaction of features in each field, to capture the feature fields (outer) interaction between resumes and jobs. To obtain the final representation of each field, a residual connection is also added to preserve its initial (inner interaction) representation from previous layer. Finally, the representations of all fields are fed to a fully connected network to obtain the final person-job fit prediction score.</p>
