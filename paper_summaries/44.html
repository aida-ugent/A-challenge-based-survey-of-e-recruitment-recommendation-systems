<p>This paper describe a job recommendation system developed for CareerBuilder. The system consists of three main steps. </p>
<p>First, they build a scalable homogeneous graph of jobs as nodes with multiple edges to represent various similarity scores between pairs of jobs. The similarity scores are computed from multiple data sources that capture users behavior as well as resumes and jobs content. The item-based graph is created rather than a user-based or user-item graph since it is more scalable.</p>
<p>The job-based multi-graph is created using co-click and co-app (for any pair of jobs, how many users click on or apply to both jobs) statistics. Next, two job-job association scores are computed based on the multi-graph. One score is computed using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to estimate the conditional probability of viewing job i given job j for each co-statistics in the multi-graph ( co-click and co-app). Since the conditional probability is biased by the popularity of the job, the other score is computed using Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) for each co-statistics in the multi-graph.</p>
<p>To overcome the cold start problem and densify the multi-graph, Deep Learning Matcher (DLM) [1] is employed to generate the embedding of each job posting and use the cosine similarity of two job posting as a similarity score between them in the graph.</p>
<p>Next, an aggregated score is computed for each pair of jobs using all different scores from behavioral and content-based signals. They only create the aggregated links when the destination node is an active job (to only recommend active jobs to people, but make use of expired jobs as well).</p>
<p>Finally for the job recommendation, three types of users are considered: active, passive and new users. For active users,  given the jobs they have interacted with, recommend their highest similar jobs according to the aggregated scores considering the recency of the interaction as well. If the number of recommended jobs is low, another round of recommendation is performed using the previously recommended jobs as source nodes in the graph. For passive and new users with an uploaded resumes, having specified job category or having old interactions with the system, users' preferences vector are created. If job category is not specified, it can be classified into pre-defined fine-grained job categories [2]. If there are some old interactions for a user, they can also identify some active jobs using the graph. With uploaded resumes, job category information and the active jobs generated using old interactions, a list of active jobs for recommendation could be generated through a personalized PageRank. For new users without resumes or job category specified in the system, recommendations are drawn from the global PageRank over the active jobs.</p>
