<p>This paper proposes APJFNN, a person-job fit model, which determines the matching degree between a job posting and user experiences in job seekers' resumes. The job postings include some requirements and resumes include user past experiences. The model consists of three components.</p>
<p>The first component is to learn the word-level embeddings of job postings and resumes using Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory network (BiLSTM). In the next component, two hierarchical structures are designed to learn the semantic representation for job requirements the experiences of users. The representation of each job requirement is computed by the embeddings of its words (initialized by word2vec) using an attention mechanism is used to model the importance of each word. Next, the full job posting embedding is computed by applying BiLSTM (to capture the sequence of requirements) and an attention mechanism (to learn the importance of each requirement). For the resumes, an attention mechanism is employed to model the importance of each word in an experience for a specific job requirement. Hence, each experience is represented by the a weighted sum of the embedding of its words for a specific job. Finally, the embedding of each resume is computed by applying mean-pooling to each experience representation (to accumulate its embedding calculated for different job requirements) followed by a BiLSTM (to capture the order of experiences) and an attention mechanism (to learn the importance of each experience for the the job posting). Finally, the representation of the job posting and the resume are passed to a fully-connected network to predict the person-job fit. The attention weights could be visualized for the interpretability of the model.</p>
