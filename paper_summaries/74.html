<p>This paper proposes a job recommendation system experimented on CareerBuilder dataset. The recommendation system provides a representation learning model which utilizes information from three networks: job transition network, job-skill network, and skill co-occurrence network. They present two novel pairwise ranking based loss functions, one based on Bayesian personalized ranking and the other one based on Margin ranking. Using the embeddings, new jobs are recommended based on a previous job. The recommendation system could also be reciprocal, but the authors do not claim or experiment it.</p>
