<p>This paper proposes PJFNN, a CNN-based (convolutional neural network based) model to match a job seeker with a job posting based on the job seeker's skills and job posting's requirement. The job postings include some requirements and resumes include user past experiences. Hence, the person-job fit could be formulated as matching job requirements with candidate experiences.</p>
<p>PJFNN consists of two parallel parts, namely, job part and resume part. This design facilitates representing job postings and resumes into the shared latent space.</p>
<p>The job part starts with encoding words in each requirement with word2vec. Next, two convolutional layers, each followed by a max-pooling are applied to each requirement. Finally, a max-pooling layer is applied to get the final job posting embedding.</p>
<p>The resume part is similar to the job part except the last layer to get the final representation, where they use a mean-pooling layer instead of the max-pooling.</p>
<p>The objective is to minimize the (cosine similarity) distance of job postings and resumes in successful applications and maximize their distance in failed applications. L2 regularization is also added to the objective function to avoid overfitting. The failed applications are constructed by replacing a successful application by randomly replacing the job posting instead of considering the actual failed applications. The reason is that actual failed applications could be due to various reasons such as low income instead of the unfitness of their work experiences and job requirements. Since the model provides representation for each requirement and work experience before the last layer, those representations could be visualized for interpretability purposes.</p>
