<p>This paper proposes a neural network based person-job fit model which first models the interaction of categorical features of jobs and resumes, and the interaction of semantic features of jobs and resumes from text. Next, the resulting embedding of interactions are passed to a MLP along with the numerical features to perform the final prediction.</p>
